# GAN and DCGAN for generating MNIST handwritten digits

This project entails building a GAN and a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) from scratch using PyTorch to generate diverse handwritten digits. We trained the models on the MNIST dataset without labels for a self-supervised approach, achieving the generation of varied handwritten digit images by introducing random noise during the process.

Note: this repository and its README will be completed over time.
